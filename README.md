# react-native-android-zxing-barcode-scanner

This is a android React Native bridge for Google's zxing barcode scanning library.

## Purpose

There are many other barcode scanning libraries available, but after using them we found the following issues.

1. Some of them are not working perfect on all the android devices.
2. The scanning speed is slower than Google's zxing, which we tested in web and pure Android as well.

So we decided to implement the bridge to improve the performance as well as overall barcode scanning experience for React Native Mobile app.
